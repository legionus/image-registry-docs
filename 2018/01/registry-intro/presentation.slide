https://github.com/openshift/image-registry

: To start our conversation about the openshift registry implementation, we need to talk about the background of this.
: And the first question is:

* What is an Image?

An image is the template for a container.

- *layer*: a tar archive bundling partial content from a filesystem
- *manifest*: the JSON representation of an image

* Manifest example

.code snippets/schema-v2.json

: This is what the manifest V2 looks like.

* Docker distribution overview

Rule: A blob is any kind of content that is stored by a registry under a content-addressable identifier (a "digest").

- as simple as possible
- stateless
- highly scalable

: No database (almost)
: No deletion of blobs (almost)

* Openshift registry features

- metadata is stored in the database (openshift master API).
- user accounts and credentials come from the openshift cluster.
- pullthrough
- mirroring
- audit logs
- prometheus metrics

: But on the other hand, our features also bring problems:

* Features disclaimer

- metadata is stored in the database ⟶ limits horizontal scalability
- user accounts and credentials ⟶ impossible to login in the registry with user/pass
- pullthrough ⟶ the possible performance and security issues
- mirroring ⟶ the possible exhaustion of the storage

* We know better how to design

* How to change the behavior of the docker/distribution

- Auth controller ‒ wraps every request
- Registry middleware ‒ wraps reqistry interface in general  - what is the "registry interface"?
- Repository middleware ‒ wraps the repository-related requests - what is the "repository"?
- Storage middleware ‒ wraps storage driver
- BlobDescriptorService ‒ implements the verification of access rights to blobs

This is all the places where we can influence behavior.

Not too much ?

: Each of them individually extends only a small part, but all together they provide many opportunities.

* How docker/distribution works

.image images/step1-docker-distribution.png

* The docker/distribution middlewares

.image images/step2-docker-distribution-middleware.png _ 900

* Supermiddleware

- register as all the middlewares - what is a middleware?
- connects middleware layers together
- controls the middleware configuration

* Supermiddleware with docker/distribution

.image images/step3-registry-middleware.png _ 900

* How we search for a blob (blobDescriptorService)

- Search among the local links in the repository
- Search globally among all blobs and try to find the blob in the database.
- Search on remote servers if allowed - pullthrough? other cases where this is allowed?

* BlobDescriptorService implementation

.code snippets/blobDescriptorService-Stat.go

* BlobDescriptorService.Stat call

.html snippets/blobDescriptorService-Stat.html

* Push Image

- *GET* `/v2/`
- *GET* `/openshift/token`
- *HEAD* `/v2/<REPO>/blobs/<DIGEST>`
- *POST* `/v2/<REPO>/blobs/uploads/`
- *PATCH* `/v2/<REPO>/blobs/uploads/<UUID>`
- *PUT* `/v2/<REPO>/blobs/uploads/<UUID>`
- *PUT* `/v2/<REPO>/manifests/<TAG>`

: [1] API version check. This is used to determine if the server supports the v2 API. Now everyone can do it(meaning there's no auth check?).
: [2] Second endpoint is used to get a session token.
: [3] Check if there is a blob.
: [4] Start uploading a new blob.
: [5] Chunked Upload. Formally, there can be many such requests, but because of the features of some storage drivers (such as S3), this is practically impossible.
: [6] Completion of the download of the blob.
: [7] Once all of the layers for an image are uploaded, the client can upload the image manifest.
: All requests are independent and the server mostly does not understand the relationship between them.

* Pull Image

- *GET* `/v2/`
- *GET* `/openshift/token`
- *GET* `/v2/<REPO>/manifests/<TAG>`
- *GET* `/v2/<REPO>/blobs/<DIGEST>`

: Let's talk about a slightly simpler query: getting an image.
: [1] API Version Check.
: [2] Get session token.
: [3] Get image manifest.(this will include the list of blobs that need to be retrieved)
: [4] Get required blob(repeated for each layer in the manifest).

* ManifestService

.code snippets/manifestservice.go

* How the request for a manifest goes through the code

.html snippets/getmanifest.html

: Here is an incomplete stack of function calls to get the manifest.
: Some developers find it difficult to understand the code since the entry point is in a completely different place.
: Processing begins in the docker/distribution code and only sometimes processing is passed to our code.

* Pullthrough & mirroring

- Transparent proxy requests to third-party registry servers
- Cache external blobs locally

: This mechanism starts if the blob is not found locally.

* BlobStore

.code snippets/blobstore.go

* Pullthrough: Stat

.code snippets/pullthroughBlobStore-Stat.go

* Pullthrough: ServeBlob

.code snippets/pullthroughBlobStore-ServeBlob.go

* Get blob

.html snippets/getblob.html

* Tag service

TagService is just an interface to the database

* Source code structure

The division into modules is not complete yet, but here is what it is now:

.html snippets/sourcecode.html

: [1] Implementation-specific definitions
: [2] Package audit log the beginning and end of each API request
: [3] Provides functions for token authentication specification
: [4] Provides facilities to speed up access to the storage backend. Unfortunately this is not enough to cache everything because some parts of the docker/distribution are not using our code.
: [5] Provides functions to make requests to openshift master API.
: [6] Module for processing an implementation-specific configuration
: [7] Provides functions for limiting incoming requests
: [8] Provides functions to collect runtime statistics
: [9] Provides functions for hard pruning
: [10] Yes, this is the supermiddleware
: [11] Middleware generator
: [12] Unsplit modules: auth, manifestService, tagService, pullthrough-related code, blobDescriptorService
